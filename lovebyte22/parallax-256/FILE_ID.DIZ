PARALLAX 256 - Turning convention upside down
and inside out, this unusual 3D text scroller
turns the text sideways whilst incorporating 
eight layers of vertical parallax. Futuristic
ambience is provided courtesy of the SID that
never gets old. So get in there and type your
own message on line four, or take the default
classic from Commodore. Either way SYS 4096
kicks off the show.
